trello-todo
===========

Automatically transfer tasks between Trello and Todoist.


This app links tasks between the [Trello](http://trello.com) and [Todoist](http://todoist.com) services.
It simplifies the workflow in which high-level planning is done in Trello
and low-level task management is done in Todoist by automatically transfering
changes made in one service to the other.
